# py-package-contents

The aim of this project is to dispense with the need for a separately hosted and compiled API doc site. 

With modern repositories like GitHub, it's trivial to view the source code in the browser without having to checkout the repo locally. We don't need the maintenance burden of a separate docsite. 

Py package contents will create a markdown contents page for your package. It provides links to the source code directly where you can read the docstrings in the context of the code itself with no need to navigate to another page. 

## Usage

Py-package-contents is provided as a python package with a CLI. Either manually run the tool or add it to your pipeline to quickly make navigable docs available for your branch.
